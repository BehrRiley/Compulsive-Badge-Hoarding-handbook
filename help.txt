	Item Defense All
	{
		Text <&Some powers give a bonus to a character's Defense. This makes that character harder to hit in combat. All +DEF powers have to be associated with one or more types of Defense. These types protect you from that type of attack. The following is a list of Defense types:
				<br><br><color lightblue>Smashing</color>
				<br><color lightblue>Lethal</color>
				<br><color lightblue>Energy</color>
				<br><color lightblue>Negative Energy</color>
				<br><color lightblue>Fire</color>

				<br><color lightblue>Psionic</color>
				<br><color lightblue>Melee</color>
				<br><color lightblue>Ranged</color>
				<br><color lightblue>Area of Effect</color>
				<br><br>When two or more powers affect the same type of Defense, they stack (meaning that they add together). If they don't, and an incoming attack qualifies as two or more qualifying attack types, then only the higher value is taken. EXAMPLE: A character has a power giving them 20% Defense to Ranged attacks, and a different power giving them 10% Defense to Fire attacks. That character has a 20% Defense to Flares (an attack that is both Fire and Range), not 30%. This is because the two powers do not stack and the system looks at the highest value.
				<br><br>Defenses that are typed as "All" or "All Except" include the Melee, Ranged and Area of Effect types as well as the normal damage types, and thus stack with everything else.&>

Others can be unlocked by earning Supergroup Badges and completing specific missions. You collect salvage by defeating mobs while in Supergroup mode. 
				<br><br>All building is done in workshops using worktables. There are three levels of worktables for both Tech and Arcane. Selecting a worktable will display a list of what you can build there.
				<br><br>Building an item is a two-step process. In the first step you use multiple pieces of  salvage to build components. Each table can build two types of components such as Tech Material or Arcane Glyph. The second step is to use these components to build the actual item. Every recipe lists the types and numbers of components you need to build it. When you choose to build a component or item, the necessary pieces are automatically removed from your salvage inventory.

						<br><br>Lackeying happens automatically when characters form a group. The <color lightblue>Boss</color> of the group is the owner of the group's currently selected mission. If the group's leader has not selected a mission, then the group leader serves as the <color lightblue>Boss</color>.

						<br><br>A <color lightblue>Lackey</color> may not enter certain <color lightblue>Trial Zones</color> that his real level would not allow. These restricted zones are Cimerora, the Hive, Monster Island, and the Abyss; some places are too dangerous for <color lightblue>Lackeys</color>! <color lightblue>Lackeys</color> also may not enter <color lightblue>PVP Zones</color> until they reach the appropriate level for those zones.
						<br><br><color lightblue>Lackeys</color> gain <color lightblue>Experience Points</color> as if they were still fighting foes near their actual level. If a <color lightblue>Lackey</color> takes on a villain 1 level above his boosted level, he'll gain the same <color lightblue>XP</color> he would normally gain by defeating a villain 1 level above his actual level.  
						<br><br>The <color lightblue>Boss</color> or <color lightblue>Lackey</color> can terminate the relationship by leaving the group.
						<br><br>A character will receive a dialog box warning them their level is about to change when they will be forced to Lackey up to the mission owner. Players can control the circumstances of when this dialog box will appear in the Options/General menu.&>

The other effects of these powers (such as any Defensive boosts) will be in effect if the power is turned on while this rule is active.

All gladiators you have unlocked are listed along with their point costs. To build your team, select any gladiator from your list using the radio buttons next to it. The cost of that creature is automatically subtracted from your total points. You can have up to 3 creatures of the same type and cannot exceed the 2000 point limit.  When you are done, select "OK" or "Apply".  The game will remember your selections, and these gladiators will be your team for any Gladiator Match.  You can return to the Gladiator screen and change your team selections at any time outside an arena battle.

If a player is effected by a Status Effect in PvP, when that effects duration ends, the player will be immune to that effect for a set period.  When the Immunity period ends, Status Effects act normally. 
			
			<br><br><color pink>De-Toggle Effects:</color>Several powers now have a chance of turning off one or more Toggle powers on a target.  
			<br><br>Powers which shut off a single Toggle:
			<br><color red>Inherent: Brawl</color>
			<br><color red>Force Field: Force Bolt</color>
			<br><color red>Kinetics: Repel</color>
			
			<br><br>Powers which have a chance of shutting off more than one Toggle:

			<br><br><color pink>Stealth:</color>  Stealth, Perception and Invisibility powers now effect the distance at which opponents (and their visual effects) are drawn.  If an opponent moves out of your visual range, you will lose targeting on them as well.  Note that many powers have been upgraded to add in a bonus to perception range to help offset the strength of Stealth powers.  
			
			<br><br><color pink>Taunt:</color>  Taunting an opponent in PvP will result in a Taunted message upon activation of any offensive power and automatic Target Change to the Taunter if he is still within range.  If you are using a Buff or Healing ability and your target is friendly, that power will work normally and not result in a Taunted message.  
			
			<br><br><color pink>Terrorize:</color>  Terror will cause effected players to stand cowering, unable to fight back for the duration of the effect.  If they are damaged, however, they may retaliate with a single attack, or attempt to flee for several seconds before the Terrorize once again freezes them in place.  
			
			<br><br><color pink>Confusion:</color>  Confuse effects will cause all entities to appear friendly to the Confused target.  Any use of Area Effect abilities will effect friend and foe alike, as you cannot tell the difference.  Any activation of a targeted power has a chance of changing targets to the next available target instead of your current target.

			<br><br><color pink>Control Effects</color>  Nearly all Control Effects (Stun, Mez, Immobilize, Terrorize, Hold) have reduced duration when used in PvP.  Additionally, these effects are subject to a 'Suppression' effect, which will prevent targets from being 'controlled' repeatedly.  The suppression period varies based upon the ability used and is generally much shorter duration that the initial Control Effect.&>

This object emits a sound and a glow to alert the players to its whereabouts. Many Architects refer to these objects as 'glowies' because of this.

					<br><br>* Attack my Target: Attacks the thing you currently have targeted. When it is defeated, revert to Follow Me command. 
					<br>* Goto: Goto a spot designated by the player. Stay there until given a different Command. 
					<br>* Follow Me: Follow the player around. 
					<br>* Stay: Stand still in this area, do not follow. (Stay is basically a "Goto the spot you are currently on") 
					<br>* Dismiss: Destroys the Henchman. 
					<br><br>These are used in combination. So "Aggressive/Follow Me" means "Follow me around, attacking anything that we get close enough to". Or "Passive/Attack My Target" means "Go attack this specific guy, and when you are done, don't attack anyone else." 
					<br><br>"Attack my Target" is not "attack everything I tab to". AMT simply sends your Henchmen to attack your currently selected target. 
					<br><br>The Disposition they are in (Aggressive/Defensive/Passive) is only relevant once that target is taken down. What happens then is the Henchman reverts to Follow Me orders, and what happens after that depends on the Disposition. 
					<br><br>Example: 
					<br><br>I have a spawn of Goldbrickers ahead. I target the Lieutenant and tell my Henchman to "Attack My Target". The Henchman then takes down the lieutenant. What happens next is is dependent on the Disposition the Henchman is in: 
					<br><br>Aggressive: Checks to see if anything else is within aggro range. There is, so it starts targeting and attacking stuff in aggro range. 
					<br>Defensive: Checks to see if it or its Master is under attack. If neither of those are true, go back to Master in Follow Me mode. 
					<br>Passive: Ignore everything going on and return to Master in Follow Me mode. 
					<br><br>The use of Dispositions and Commands for Henchmen is used exclusively by Masterminds and only on their Henchmen pets. Other summoned pets can not be controlled, nor will Dominators or City of Heroes Controllers get the ability to command their pets to this level of detail. Those pet powers have been balanced with a certain level of control in mind.&>

		Text <&The commands (which should show up with /cmdlist) are: 
					<br>/petcom (your current pet) 
					<br>/petcom_name (name matching pet) 
					<br>/petcom_pow (power matching pet) 
					<br>/petcom_all (all pets) 
					<br><br>/petsay 
					<br>/petsay_pow 
					<br>/petsay_name 
					<br>/petsay_all 
					<br>Each of the petcom commands can be followed by one stance and/or one command. That probably sounds complicated so here are some examples: 
					<br><br>/petcom passive (tell current pet to be passive) 
					<br>/petcom_name "zombie 2" dismiss (tell "zombie 2" to leave) 
					<br>/petcom_pow Protector attack aggressive (tell all pets created by "Protector Bots" to attack your target and be aggressive) 
					<br><br>/petcom_all goto defensive (tell all pets to goto a spot and be defensive) 
					<br><br>FYI: All of the words after the command, the game will search for a best match, so you don't have to type in the full words: 
					<br>/bind mbutton petcom_name zom att def 
					<br>That would bind a command to the middle mouse button to make all pets with name starting with "zom", in this case zombies, attack and be defensive. 
					<br><br>The petsay commands work the same way, but will allow you to have your pet say something: 
					<br><br>/petsay_all <em praise>You are the greatest! 
					<br><br>That will make your Henchmen bow and worship you.&>
